# ðŸŽ² Sudoku Solver

This is a simple project with an automated sudoku solver and a pygame based GUI interface.
Project concept is based on techwithtim's GUI-solver project: https://github.com/techwithtim/Sudoku-GUI-Solver

## ðŸ’» Backtracking Algorithm

The main 'solve' algorithm is based on the backtracking algorithm, which aims to find a solution to a problem by eliminating one possibility at a time. Different possibilities are laid out in order through recursion. 

The bulk of the text-based solver implementation can be found in solver.py.

Details about the algorithm can be found in this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/
