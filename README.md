# ðŸŽ² Sudoku Solver

This is a simple project with an automated sudoku solver and a pygame based GUI interface.
Project concept is based on [techwithtim's GUI-solver project](https://github.com/techwithtim/Sudoku-GUI-Solver)

## ðŸ’» Backtracking Algorithm

The main `solve` algorithm is based on the backtracking algorithm, which aims to find a solution to a problem by eliminating one possibility at a time. Different possibilities are laid out in order through recursion. The bulk of the text-based solver implementation can be found in `solver.py`.

Details about the backtracking algorithm can be found in [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/)

## ðŸŽ® Pygame

Pygame is a Python module designed for video game production. In this project, I have implemented the module to create a GUI version of the game of sudoku. In it, you have the option to either play the actual game of sudoku or turn to an automated solution generator by pressing space bar.

You can enter values manually by clicking available box, entering numeric value and pressing enter. Upon enter command, the game checks whether the value entered is valid and accepts/rejects value.

By pressing space bar you can run the `solve` command.
